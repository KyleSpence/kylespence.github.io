# 🔌 500 Error: Server Unplugged Itself!

Uh-oh! The server tried to process your request but experienced a catastrophic case of **ID10T** error. 🤦‍♂️

## What Happened?
- The server is currently trying to debug its existential crisis. 🤯
- It’s possible someone configured a firewall rule that blocks **happiness**.
- The application stack just took a tumble like a house of cards. 🎴
- There was a conflict between the sysadmin’s coffee and the server's uptime. ☕ ➡️ 🔥

### Here’s what you can try:
1. **Refresh the page** — maybe it’ll snap out of its funk. 🤞
2. **Check back later** when the server has had a chance to take a nap and restart. 😴🔄
3. **Consult the nearest network admin** with a sacrificial offering of energy drinks. 🥤

### In the meantime, enjoy this tech joke:
> Why do programmers prefer dark mode?  
> **Because the light attracts bugs!** 🪲

**Status:** 500 Internal Server Error  
**Error Code:** `ERR_SERVER_HAS_GONE_BERSERK`
